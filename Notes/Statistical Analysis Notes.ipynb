    "<b>Information:</b>    \n",
    "Information is defined as knowledge gained through study, communication, research or instruction.  \n",
    "It is the result of analyzing and interpreting pieces of data.  \n",
    "eg:  \n",
    "- Temperature readings in a location -> Data\n",
    "- Determine seasonal temperature patterns -> Information\n",

    "\n",
    "<b>Difference between data & information:</b>    \n",
    "- Data is a collection of facts, while information puts those facts into context.  \n",
    "- While data is raw and unorganised, information is organised.  \n",
    "- Data points are individual and sometimes unrelated. Information maps out that data to provide a big-picture view of how it all fits together.  \n",
    "- Data, on its own, is meaningless. When its analyzed and interpreted, it becomes meaningful information.  \n",
    "- Data doesnot depend on information; however, information depends on data.  \n",
    "- Data typically comes in the form of graphs, numbers, figures or statistics. Information is typically presented through words, languages, thoughts and ideas.  \n",
    "- Data isnt sufficient for decision-making, but you can make decisions based on information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Examples:</b>  \n",
    "- At a restaurant, a single customer's bill amount is data. However, when the restaurant owners collect and interpret multiple bills over a range of time, they can produce valuable information, such as what menu items are most popular and whether the prices are sufficient to cover supplies, overhead and wages.  \n",
    "- A customer's reponse to an individual customer service survey is a point of data. But when you compile that customer's responses over time - and, on a grander scheme, multiple customer's responses over time - you can develop insights around areas for improvement within your customer service team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data and Information are both critical elements in business decision-making. By understanding how these components work together, you can move your business toward a more data and insights driven culture."

    "<b>viii. Standard Scores:</b>\n",
    "- Standard Scores is also known as \"z-scores\".\n",
    "- z-scores are a way to compare results from a test to a \"normal\" population.\n",
    "- Describes how many Standard Deviations an element is from its mean.\n",
    "- For a particular element(value); \n",
    "    - If z-score < 0, the element is less than the mean.\n",
    "    - If z-score = 0, the element is equal the mean.\n",
    "    - If z-score > 0, the element is greater than the mean.\n",
    "- The formula to calculate z-score is:  \n",
    "    z = $\\frac{x - x̄}{S}$  \n",
    "    where,  \n",
    "        S = standard deviation of a sample  \n",
    "        x = each value in the sample dataset  \n",
    "        x̄ = mean of the sample\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Why use Standard Score?</b>\n",
    "- Standard Score (z-score) is a set of scores that have the same mean and standard deviaion so they can be compared.\n",
    "- we use the standard score which allows us to:\n",
    "    - Calculate the probability of a score occuring within our normal distribution.\n",
    "    - Compare two scores that are from different normal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we apply standard scaler (z-score) to our dataset, it will convert the particular column such that, the Mean of the column will be 0 & the Standard Deviation of the column will be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Advantages of z-score:</b>\n",
    "- z-score can be used to compare raw scores that are taken from different tests.\n",
    "- z-score considers both the mean value and the variability in a set of raw scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Disadvantages of z-score:</b>\n",
    "- It always assumes our the dataset to be normally distributed.\n",
    "- If the data is skewed, the distribution of the left and right of the origin line is not equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>How is z-score used in real life?</b>\n",
    "- We can use the z-table and the normal distribution graph to give us a visual about how a z-score of 2.0 means \"heigher than average\".\n",
    "- Lets say we have a person's weight (140 kg), and we know their z-score is 2.0. We know that 2.0 is above average (because of the high placement on the normal distribuion curve), but we want to now how much above average is this weight.\n",
