    "<b>Data:</b>  \n",
    "Data is defined as individual facts, while information is the organization and interpretation of those facts. It is the raw form of knowledge.  \n",
    "Data can be in various forms:\n",
    "- Text\n",
    "- Observations\n",
    "- Figures\n",
    "- Numbers\n",
    "- Graphs, etc.  \n",
    "Example: Individual prices, weights, addresses, ages, names, temperatures, dates or distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Types of Data:</u>  \n",
    "- Quantitative Data: Dealing with numerical form.  \n",
    "Eg: Salary, Weight, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "- Qualitative Data: Dealing with non-numerical data.  \n",
    "Eg: Name, Gender, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Information:</b>    \n",
    "Information is defined as knowledge gained through study, communication, research or instruction.  \n",
    "It is the result of analyzing and interpreting pieces of data.  \n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "- Temperature readings in a location -> Data\n",
    "- Determine seasonal temperature patterns -> Information\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Difference between data & information:</b>    \n",
    "- Data is a collection of facts, while information puts those facts into context.  \n",
    "- While data is raw and unorganised, information is organised.  \n",
    "- Data points are individual and sometimes unrelated. Information maps out that data to provide a big-picture view of how it all fits together.  \n",
    "- Data, on its own, is meaningless. When its analyzed and interpreted, it becomes meaningful information.  \n",
    "- Data doesnot depend on information; however, information depends on data.  \n",
    "- Data typically comes in the form of graphs, numbers, figures or statistics. Information is typically presented through words, languages, thoughts and ideas.  \n",
    "- Data isnt sufficient for decision-making, but you can make decisions based on information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Examples:</b>  \n",
    "- At a restaurant, a single customer's bill amount is data. However, when the restaurant owners collect and interpret multiple bills over a range of time, they can produce valuable information, such as what menu items are most popular and whether the prices are sufficient to cover supplies, overhead and wages.  \n",
    "- A customer's reponse to an individual customer service survey is a point of data. But when you compile that customer's responses over time - and, on a grander scheme, multiple customer's responses over time - you can develop insights around areas for improvement within your customer service team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data and Information are both critical elements in business decision-making. By understanding how these components work together, you can move your business toward a more data and insights driven culture."
